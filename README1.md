# Web-services-project-2022
This project is a part of a Web Services course tought at Tunis Business School.
In this self-designed Action Project, I am asked to  demonstrate my learning and design an API that meets the needs of your potential users and allow them to manage their data using CRUD operations.
Technical Requirements:
-Store resources in SQL database
-Integrate a DBMS (postgres, Mysql, etc.)
-Ensure secure API access 
-Implement applicable security policies.
-Git-Version control
-Use SSH keys for security
-Host your API in the cloud (e.g., Heroku)
-Deploy your API (e.g., NGINX, uWSGI)
-Test your APIâ€™s security and validate any other critical non-functional requirements.
-Automate Your API Tests (Postman, Newman, etc)

I will use Python language to create my API
